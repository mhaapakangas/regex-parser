# Progress report: Week 3

This week I finished the core functionality of the program. I completed tests and documentation for
the NFA builder, and added new logic for matching an input string against a regex.

The plan for next week is to replace the java data structures with my own ones. The java.util.ArrayDeque
will be replaced with a simple stack. A possible replacement for java.util.HashSet used in the regex
matcher is tree.
