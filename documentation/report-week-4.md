# Progress report: Week 4

This week I replaced java.util.ArrayDeque with an own stack implementation. I started working on performance
testing. This included writing scripts to facilitate taking measurements using my algorithm, java regex matcher
and grep. I also drew the current class diagram for the project and described it for the implementation documentation.

The plan for next week is to replace the java.util.HashSet still used in the regex matcher with my own data structure.
After that, I can continue with the performance testing and start taking actual measurements.
