# Progress report: Week 1

This week I researched regular expression parsers, and selected Thompson's
algorithm as the topic for the project. I looked into how the algorithm 
works and what data structures it uses. I set up the project, but didn't start
with the implementation yet.

The plan is to next implement logic for converting the input into the postfix
notation. After that I can start constructing the algorithm itself.

**Time spent:** 3 h
